# The Weather Experience

Atmosphere is is a sample weather app that showcases the use of the popular Unity Engine in a normal Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application.

**Features:** | Unity and XAML interop | App Services | App Extensions
---|---|---|---

The app renders a 3D layer below a 2D XAML layer. The 3D world renders the weather with special effects like rain, thunder, clouds and so on for each day, and then the XAML User Interface (UI) layer communicates the information to the user. The app also showcases the use of app extensions that enable other developers to extend certain areas of the app â€“ in this case, the extension provides music that matches the mood of the current weather. In addition, the weather service used by the app is exposed through an app service that enables other apps to use that weather information, as illustrated by [Fourth Coffee](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppDevXbox/tree/news).
